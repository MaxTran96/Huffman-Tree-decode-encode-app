Dear Rebecca,
 
   I am very grateful that you are our T.A, because you did a great job explaining 
difficult CSE concepts and algorithms, and grading our coding assignments. Not only that,
you are always there for help whenever needed. I think it is really interesting how you can 
efficiently store a huge size of data and does cool things with it. Anyways, I wish you keep 
teaching CSE classes because you teaching is fun and your explanations are very easy to understand

  Sincerely,
  Max Tran
